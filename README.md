# Disclaimer
## WARNING: THESE SCRIPTS OFTEN MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND HAVE VERY LITTLE ERROR HANDLING. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

These scripts are created with my specific use-case in mind. I usually make an effort to write things in a generalized way, but I don't always have the (ability|time|fucks) to consider anything beyond my specific needs at the time of writing. In these cases, they should be considered as reference or demo only.

### Generally: If you cannot read the script in question, you should not attempt to run it as-is.

This is not a comment on any individual's knowledge or skills, but is intended as a measuring stick for the state of the repo as a whole.

# Contributing
Turns out I'm not perfect, so patches, modifications, suggestions, and issues are always welcome!

Also, I'm always up for finding better ways to do things, so alternative workflows are welcome as well!
